Rates of binary formation through gravitational capture for a self gravitating spherical cluster.

Calculates maximum pericenter distance for gravitational radiation capture,
cross section, timescale for 2body encounters and number of encounters per
relaxation time and cluster lifetime (~100 relaxation times)


encounters(N,m,rmin,rmax,b)
N: total number of objetcs
m: mass of a single object in M_sol 
rmin: Smallest cluster radius in parsecs
rmax: The bigger cluster radius in parsecs
b: [0.1,1] passage distance in maximum pericenter distances

Example:
encounters(1E6,10,0.1,5.1,1)

It prints the results for a cluster with radius rmin and a cluster with radius rmax.
